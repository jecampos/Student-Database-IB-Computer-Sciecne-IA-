# Student Database
A Student Database Project that I had made for my IB Computer Science SL Internal Assessment for the May 2021 exams.

# Description
For this project I used Java and SQLite to create a student database program that can hold students, class, and grades. I had also used NetBeans to create this project as it was a IDE that made creating a GUI in Java a lot more flexible and efficent than other IDEs. I had recieved a 7 ot of 7 on this and if you have any questions or want me to include other things, you can contact me at any point about it.
