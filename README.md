# Student Database
A Student Database Project that I had made for my IB Computer Science SL Internal Assessment for the May 2021 exams.

# Description
For this project I had used Java and SQLite to create a student database program that can hold students, class, and grades. I had recieved a 7 out of 7 on this and if you have 
any questions or want me to include other things, you can contact me at any point about it.
